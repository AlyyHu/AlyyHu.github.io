# Data Science in Business World

This part covers the first 2 classes in data science course.

## Data Mining & Business
For business analysis, data mining is just a tool for us to make business decisions. As a result, when we have available data for us to analyze, it is important for us to not only understand the data, but also in aware of what business problem are we trying to figure out. 

**Mind pitfalls!**

* Original available data may not be the data you want to use for analysis
* Do not use only information available for final use(Availability heuristic LOL)

**What we should do:**

* Split the final task into *core data mining tasks*. Use different data mining tools for different tasks.
* Combine results from core tasks & analyze them to get insights / make decisions / and deploy them!

## Taxonomy and Core Tasks

For each problem we are trying to handle, we need to look at:

* Core tasks
* Specific methods


There are two kinds of **learning process**:

* Supervised learning: there's a goal or target variable we are trying to fit with the data. For instance, predictive analytics.
* Unsupervised learning: no goal or target variable, we are just exploring the data and trying to find interesting facts.

And tons of **core tasks**...

* Regression
* Classification
* Clustering
* Dimension
* Reduction
* Hypothesis Testing(I've done enough of this in the first term...)
* Co-occurrence
* ......

## Predictive Modeling

Goal of predictive model is to **pretict target(Y) using available information(X)**, which means we don't care about **how X affect Y**.

### Deviance and R Square

We use Deviance and R Square to measure how a predictive model fits the data.

**Deviance**: distance between data and predictions

**In-sample R Square**:
